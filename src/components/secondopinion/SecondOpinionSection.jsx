          When to Seek a Second Opinion?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black leading-relaxed">
          A second opinion gives you the confidence and clarity you need about your diagnosis and treatment plan. It can confirm whether your current approach is appropriate or suggest better alternatives for a safer and faster recovery.

        </p>
        <p className="text-black leading-relaxed mt-4">
         You should consider getting a second opinion if youâ€™ve been advised a major surgery or complex treatment, diagnosed with a serious or rare condition, exploring advanced treatment options not available locally, or want reassurance before starting a long-term or high-risk treatment.
